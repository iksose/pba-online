Open-Source Phishing Toolkit

Gophish is an open-source phishing toolkit designed for businesses and penetration testers. It provides the ability to quickly and easily setup and execute phishing engagements.

###Current Status
Development of gophish is currently ongoing. It is not anywhere close to being functional yet, but should get there soon.

Until then, you can keep up-to-date with development news and articles on [my blog](http://jordan-wright.github.io/blog/categories/gophish/).

###Install

Installation of gophish is dead-simple - once the binaries are released (coming soon!), just download and extract the zip, and run the binary. Gophish will have binary releases for all platforms.

###Setup
After running the gophish binary, open an Internet browser to http://localhost:3333 and login with the default username (admin) and password (gophish).
